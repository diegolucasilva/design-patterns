/*
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms,
put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

Usage examples: The Strategy pattern is very common in Java code. Itâ€™s often used in various frameworks
to provide users a way to change the behavior of a class without extending it.

EX:
java.util.Comparator#compare() called from Collections#sort().
