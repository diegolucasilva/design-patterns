In Software Engineering, Structural Design Patterns are Design Patterns that ease the design by
identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures
while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

A structural design pattern serves as a blueprint for how different classes and objects are combined to form larger structures.
Unlike creational patterns, which are mostly different ways to fulfill the same fundamental purpose,
each structural pattern has a different purpose.
