Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

***
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
